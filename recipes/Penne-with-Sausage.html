    <p>This is such a simple recipe, but what great flavor. Not to worry if you haven't seen that pesto packet before because I haven't. I used my homemade pesto and simply decreased the amount of olive oil. Also, because the packet said creamy I used light cream instead of milk. Simple adjusments that work out very well. I used Johnsonville sweet sausage. It came out perfect. The flavor combination is spot on. Everyone loved it.</p>

    <h2>/ingredients</h2>
    <ul>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</ul>
    <ul>½ pound ground sausage</ul>
    <ul>1 (1.2 ounce) package creamy pesto sauce mix (such as Knorr®)</ul>
    <ul>1 cup milk</ul>
    <ul>¼ cup olive oil</ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>Step 1</li>
    <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook penne at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain and transfer pasta to a bowl.</p>
    <li>Step 2</li>
    <p>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; add to pasta</p>
    <li>Step 3</li>
    <p>Whisk pesto sauce mix, milk, and olive oil together in a small saucepan; bring to a boil while stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low and keep at a simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes; pour over pasta and sausage mixture and toss to coat.    </p>
