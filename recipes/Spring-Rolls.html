    <p>Spring rolls are appetizers that consist of a savory filling in a paper-thin wrapper made from flour and water. The exterior is so thin and crispy, it will shatter to the touch. Spring roll wrappers are thinner and more delicate than egg roll wrappers. 

        Vietnamese spring rolls (or gỏi cuốn) contain pork, shrimp, rice vermicelli noodles, and vegetables in a rice paper wrapper.</p>
    
    <h2>How to Make Vietnamese Spring Rolls</h2>
    <p>Here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make Vietnamese spring rolls at home: </p>
    <li>Cook the pasta. </li>
    <li>Soften each wrapper in warm water, then add the filling ingredients.</li>
    <li>Fold and roll each spring roll. </li>
    <li>Make the sauces to serve with the spring rolls.     </li>

    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>2 ounces rice vermicelli    </ul>
    <ul>8 rice wrappers (8.5 inch diameter)</ul>
    <ul>8 large cooked shrimp - peeled, deveined and cut in half</ul>
    <ul>2 leaves lettuce, chopped</ul>
    <ul>3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</ul>
    <ul>3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</ul>
    <ul>1 ⅓ tablespoons chopped fresh Thai basil</ul>
    
    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <li>Step 1</li>
    <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in vermicelli pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
    <li>Step 2</li>
    <p>Fill a large bowl with warm water. Dip one wrapper into the hot water for 1 second to soften. Lay wrapper flat; place 2 shrimp halves in a row across the center, add some vermicelli, lettuce, mint, cilantro, and basil, leaving about 2 inches uncovered on each side. Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with lettuce. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</p>
    <li>Step 3</li>
    <p>For the sauces: Mix water, lime juice, sugar, fish sauce, garlic, and chili sauce in a small bowl until well combined. Mix hoisin sauce and peanuts in a separate small bowl.</p>
    <li>Step 4</li>
    <p>erve rolled spring rolls with fish sauce and hoisin sauce mixtures.</p>
