<p>This recipe turns the cheese on the pizza into the crust itself. So genius. Watch the video to see how easy it is to make with a non-stick pan. Top it any way you want, but use a light touch so the thin crust doesn't fall apart.</p>

<h2>ingredients</h2>

<ul>1 Â½ cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</ul>
<ul>5 cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced</ul>
<ul>2 tablespoons torn fresh basil leaves</ul>
<ul>4 small fresh mozzarella balls (bocconcini), thinly sliced</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>

<li>Step 1</li>
<p>Heat a 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly into hot skillet; cook until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
<li>Step 2</li>
<p>Arrange tomato slices, basil leaves, and fresh mozzarella slices on the melted cheese, leaving space for a "crust" to form; cook until top is bubbling and edges are browned, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
<li>Step 3</li>
<p>Remove skillet from heat and loosen pizza with a spatula. Gently slice pizza onto a cutting board; cool for 1 minute before slicing.
